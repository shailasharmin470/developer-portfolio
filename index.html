            <p>The cat is a domestic animal. Its scientific name is Felis catus. It is a small animal that belongs to
                the
                “Felidae” family. The cat is the only domesticated species of the family. Other members include tigers,
                panthers, etc. Cats are adorable animals and are petted by lots of people in the world. They are playful
                and
                spending time with them reduces stress and anxiety.</p>

            <p>The most common and popular breed of cat by far, the Domestic Shorthair title covers pretty much the
                whole gamut of moggies that don't fall under any specific breed. They've been around since at least
                2000BC and come in all shapes, sizes and colorings.</p>

                <p>Basic cat training can help you teach your cat to come to you when called, get them in to a cat
                    carrier
                    as well as feel more comfortable being in one,When most people think about training animals, they
                    think
                    about teaching them specific things such as performing a ‘stay’, ‘roll over’ or giving a paw.
                    However,
                    any time your cat learns to do more or less of something based on your behaviour, you are in effect
                    training or teaching them.</p>
