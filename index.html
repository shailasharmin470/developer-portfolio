            <h2>Cat Breeds</h2>
            <p>The most common and popular breed of cat by far, the Domestic Shorthair title covers pretty much the
                whole gamut of moggies that don't fall under any specific breed. They've been around since at least
                2000BC and come in all shapes, sizes and colorings.</p>
